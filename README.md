## Grading Notes

Your grade is a reflection not only of your ability to write code to pass existing tests, but also of your ability to construct software in a professional setting. Therefore, the following will contribute rather heavily to your score:

- **Following all submission instructions**! Pay attention to every requirement such as replacing the contents of this readme file and including the names of all participants of any group work.
- **Keeping a pristine GitHub repository**. Do not push any file that does not belong (including but not limited to that silly `DS_Store`). Make sure all generated executables, intermediate files, third-party libraries, etc. are not committed. Your repo contents should be limited to your solution files, tests, configuration files, and `.gitignore` files.
- **Adherence to naming and formatting conventions for the language you are writing in**. Inconsistent indentation, for example, has no place in professional or student software. Neither does end-of-line whitespace, huge chunks of contiguous blank lines, and other types of messy coding practices that show friends, family, colleagues, and potential employers that you donâ€™t care about your work.
- (As always) The **readability and maintainability** of your code.
